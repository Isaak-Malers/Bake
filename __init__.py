"""
Provides the simplest possible wrapper for exposing python functions to be run on a command line!
Annotate python functions with the [@cli_function] decorator, and annotate the function fully with the builtin python tools.
The library will generate a man page for your file, and provide helpful error messages when arguments are not formatted correctly.
